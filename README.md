# TypeScript Bug: Type 'string[]' is not assignable to type 'string'

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript where a function expecting a string argument is passed an array of strings.  The error message is: `Type 'string[]' is not assignable to type 'string'.`

The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.ts` provides a corrected version.

This example highlights the importance of type safety in TypeScript and shows how to effectively handle type mismatches.
